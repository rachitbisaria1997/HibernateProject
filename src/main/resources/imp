hibernate is built on ORM framework.

1. using hibernate, user does not need to create and manage table. Java classes or POJO are automatically
mapped to tables. just need to provide DB and connection details. It will connect with database by providing config
in hibernate.cfg.xml file
2. user doesnt need to write any SQL queries manually like in JDBC.
3. hibernate provides caching - 1st, 2nd and 3rd level

common annotations in hibernate
1. @Entity - to mark a class as entity
2. @Table -  use to change the table name.
3. @Id - use to mark column as primary key
4. @GeneratedValue - generates value for primary key. it will automatically increment, no need to set it manually
5. @Column - it can be used to specify column mappings. to change column name in associated table in DB
6. @Transient - tells hibernate not to save this field in DB
7. @Temporal - tells hibernate in which the date needs to be saved
8. @Lob - tells hibernate that this is a large object not a simple object
9. @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @JoinColumn

XML mappings in hibernate.cfg.xml.. if you don’t provide mappings in hibernate.cfg.xml (or via annotations + auto-scanning),
Hibernate will not know about your entity classes, so it will not create the corresponding tables.

<mapping class="com.tut.Student"/>
<mapping class="com.tut.Address"/>

<property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>

if its update then table will be created if not exists
if its create then table will be created everytime

session.get() - returns null if object is not found in cache as well in DB..
if data exists in session cache, it will not hit the database

session.load() - if object is not found then it will throw ObjectNotFoundException.
it returns a proxy data in place and only initializes / hit SQL query when any method other than
ex stud.getName() is called on entity object. its called lazy initialization.. increases performance

Hibernate lifecycle states

1. transient
2. persistent
3. detached
4. removed state

When a new object is created and having some values set using setters. its transient state.
not associated with data or session

when session.save(obj) persist(), obj is associated with session - it goes to persistent state.
data is avail in session and database

when session.close() or session.clear() is called then object goes to detached state
when called session.update() then it goes back to persistent state

when called session.delete(obj) then its deleted from DB. still associated in session
its removed state

HQL is database independent. HQL queries work with oracle, my SQL server
